## Description

Starting from scratch, this quiz application was built to test my knowledge of javascript functions, local storage, and CSS styling. 

The application uses the Durstenfeld shuffle method to shuffle an array of question that are then displayed in a random order during the timed quiz.

### Try to beat the clock and answer as many questions correctly as you can! Remember, incorrect answers make you lose 15 seconds on the clock!
